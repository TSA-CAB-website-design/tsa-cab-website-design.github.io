                Cab Calloway was a black performer during the Harlem Renaissance. 
                He was born on December 25, 1907, in Rochester, New York. After briefly pursuing a law education, he became a singer and began a musical career.
                He created many jazz hits, earning himself the nickname as the “hi-de-ho” man. 
                Some of his songs include “Minnie the Moocher”, “Hi De Ho Man”, “The Jumpin’ Jive”, and “St. James Infirmary”. Moreover, he was in various films, 
                including “Stormy Weather”, “The Blues Brothers”, “Hi-De-Ho”, “St. Louis Blues”, and “International House”.
